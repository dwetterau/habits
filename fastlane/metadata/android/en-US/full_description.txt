Privacy
- This app never sends any of your data anywhere (currently, there are no network calls in the codebase!).
- I will never add ads to this application.
- I will never collect or send your data anywhere.
- If the app asks for an unexpected permission please submit an issue on Github! It should only ask to store data locally and to send you a reminder location.

Controls
- Long press on a habit to enter the "edit" menu for it. This view will show a list of "events" for each habit.
- Tap on an event's date or time to edit when it happened.
- On the Summary page, you can tap an "archived" habit to un-archive it.
